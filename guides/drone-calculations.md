# Drone Calculations

## Motor Thrust

$$
\left( \frac{D \cdot Kv \cdot V}{109980} \right)^2
$$

Where,\
D = Propeller Diameter in Inches\
Kv = Motor Velocity Coefficient\
V = Battery Voltage



## Charger Compatibility

If battery is 5200mAh, the charging current must be no more than 5200mA or 5.2A so chargers must be ranked by charging current and battery voltage
