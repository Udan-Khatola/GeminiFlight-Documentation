# Swarming

The plan is to use UWB modules for swarming. Instead of anchoring them, we need to develop a P2P network between the drones. This would be used for collision avoidance and relative localization. Each drone can also stream it's GPS coordinates over the UWB stream. The idea is to create a pseudo-RTK system. This would drastically bring down the hardware cost of making drone swarms
