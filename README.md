# GeminiFlight-Documentation

## Introduction

GeminiFlight is an innovative open-source drone ecosystem designed to provide a comprehensive solution for drone enthusiasts and professionals. This ecosystem comprises hardware, firmware, and software components, with a unique architecture that separates the traditional flight controller into two distinct units: the [Flight Stabilization System (FSS)](flight-stabilization-system.md) and the [Autonomous Guidance System (AGS)](autonomous-guidance-system.md).

## Features

* Split architecture with FSS and AGS for enhanced control and abstraction.
* Precise orientation estimation with MPU6050 IMU on FSS.
* AGS acts as an intermediary, reducing pilot effort with layered abstractions.
* NAVIC constellation support for improved accuracy in the Indian subcontinent.
* Onboard GPS for stable position hold capabilities.
* High-quality, low-latency video transmission for FPV flying.
* Machine learning model support on AGS for advanced applications.
* Long-range WiFi for pilot communication and 4G IoT for BVLOS capabilities.
* NPNT compliance and readiness for BVLOS operations in compliance with future regulations.
