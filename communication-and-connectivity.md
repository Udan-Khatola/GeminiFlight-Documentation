# Communication and Connectivity

GeminiFlight leverages an isolated long-range WiFi network for communication with the pilot, ensuring a robust and reliable connection. Additionally, it incorporates a 4G Internet of Things (IoT) connection, offering Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) capabilities with infinite range. This connectivity, coupled with NPNT compliance, positions GeminiFlight as a leading contender for BVLOS operations in India.

GeminiFlight is designed to adhere to evolving legal frameworks, and once BVLOS policies are enacted into law, it aims to be the first quality-certified flight controller for BVLOS operations in India.
